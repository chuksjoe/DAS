#Departmental Administrative System (DAS) software
This an Academic Project done by me for the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of National Diploma(ND) in Computer Science in Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri, Imo state, Nigeria.
Dated, September 2012.
The Departmental Administrative System (DAS) software is an information system that is used to manage, organize and store student’s information. It has the capability of storing students’ bio-data and contact details and also their results and grades. It can be used for all the levels in the department where it is applied. The methodology adopted in carrying out this project is called Structured System Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) and the outputs are stored in a database.
The software is a Database Management System (DBMS) which uses Microsoft Access 2007 for the Database and Visual Basic 6.0 for designing the front-end interface due to its graphical user interface (GUI) features and its platform independency.
